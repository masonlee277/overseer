## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/overseer.git
   cd overseer
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the package and dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Start

'''python
config = OverseerConfig('config/overseer_config.yaml')
data_manager = DataManager(config)
sim_manager = SimulationManager(config)
env = ElmfireGymEnv(config)
'''

This Quick Start guide demonstrates the core workflow of the Overseer framework:

1. **Configuration Management**:

   - `OverseerConfig` loads settings from a YAML file, providing a centralized configuration for all components.

2. **Logging**:

   - `OverseerLogger` sets up a consistent logging system across all components.

3. **Data Handling**:

   - `DataManager` manages simulation data, storing and retrieving episode information.
   - `ElmfireDataInHandler` handles the ELMFIRE input file (elmfire.data.in), allowing for dynamic updates to simulation parameters.

4. **Geospatial Analysis**:

   - `GeoSpatialManager` performs spatial calculations and visualizations, such as fire intensity calculation and risk area identification.

5. **Simulation Management**:

   - `SimulationManager` interfaces with the ELMFIRE simulator, managing the execution of fire spread simulations.

6. **Reinforcement Learning Environment**:

   - `ElmfireGymEnv` provides a Gym-compatible environment for RL agents to interact with the ELMFIRE simulation.

7. **Simulation Loop**:

   - The environment is reset, and steps are taken using actions (randomly sampled in this example, but would be provided by an RL agent in practice).
   - Observations, rewards, and other information are processed and stored at each step.

8. **Post-Simulation Analysis**:
   - After the simulation, the framework provides tools for analyzing the results, including visualization of fire progression and generation of risk maps.
   - Performance metrics are calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of the fire suppression strategies.

This Quick Start guide showcases the integration of various components in the Overseer framework, demonstrating how they work together to create a comprehensive system for ELMFIRE simulation with reinforcement learning capabilities.
